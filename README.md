## Go JSON Parser

# Summary
I found this [challenge](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser) and wanted to give it a try since i've never parsed anything before.  I also used it as another opportunity to learn Go.  

If given a JSON file, the program will return if it is valid or invalid JSON.

It works with all of the test files provided in the challenge - still need to do further testing

# Disclaimer 
This project was created to continue learning Go. please be nice
